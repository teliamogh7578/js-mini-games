# JS Mini Games

A collection of mini games built using JavaScript while learning core concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.  
This repository will continuously grow as new JavaScript concepts are learned and practiced.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Learn JavaScript through hands-on projects
- Apply each new concept by building a small interactive game
- Improve problem-solving and logical thinking
- Maintain a public record of consistent learning and progress

## Structure

Each game will be organized in its own folder with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Learning Approach

- Every game is tied to one or more JavaScript concepts
- Games may start simple and be improved over time
- Code quality and structure will improve as learning progresses

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Games Completed

### 1. Guess the Number

Status: ✅ Completed

Concepts used:

- Variables and conditionals
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Game state management (win/lose)
- High score tracking

### 2. Pig Game

Status: ✅ Completed

A two-player dice game built to practice JavaScript game state management and turn-based logic.

Concepts used:

- State management (active player, current score, total score)
- Turn-based gameplay logic
- Randomization using dice rolls
- DOM updates and UI state control
- Event-driven interactions (roll, hold, new game)
- Game-over handling and button disabling

### 3. Reaction Time Game

Status: ✅ Completed

A reaction-time testing game inspired by minimal interactive experiments, focused on precision and timing.

Concepts used:

- Timers using `setTimeout` and timestamp calculations
- Game state management (idle, waiting, ready)
- User interaction handling and feedback
- Randomized delays and early-click detection
- High score tracking

## Status

🚧 In progress: new games will be added regularly as part of continuous learning.
